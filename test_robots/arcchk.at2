; Check whether the scanner arc is drawn correctly
; First set the arc to 2 (+/- 2), then fire at -4 and 4.

; Firing doesn't travel along the edge lines. What is more, where it fails
; depends on at what angle we are. The turret angle input is the same on both
; fire and draw_scanner, so that's not it.
